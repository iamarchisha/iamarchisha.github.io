Well, someone's curious about ME!

TL;DR: Engineer, speaker, failed founder, mindful builder. Learning the business of impact, one imperfect iteration at a time.

Wanted to be an artist. Became an engineer. Built models. Then built a business. It failed. So I built myself.

I was the kid who drew more than she spoke. Changed schools five times. Learned to adapt. Got good at swimming. My parents said: “Art is for the rich.” So I studied computer engineering.

Then I met AI. It felt like art, just with code. I went all in. GitHub projects, open-source work, internships, research gigs. Eventually joined Fractal Analytics, building data science models that made real money move. But something was off.

At 24, I quit to sell coconut oil.

My family has farms. I had ambition. Cold-pressed, small-batch, clean-label. I built a brand, pitched stores, ran Instagram ads. And failed. Not because the product was bad, but because I knew nothing about distribution, margins, or what it takes to make people care. The market ate me alive.

That failure became my MBA application.

Now I’m at ESCP Business School - Paris to London. Strategy, marketing, finance. The full 360°. I’ve co-founded two ventures, led a Toastmasters club to gold, trained 80+ students in AI, and learned to stand in rooms and make people listen.

I still draw. I still swim. But now I’m building again. Smarter.

Let’s connect and grow together.
