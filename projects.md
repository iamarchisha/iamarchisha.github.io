# Timeline

I like to think of my journey as a thread of small decisions — sometimes strategic, sometimes accidental — all driven by curiosity to understand how ideas become real.

## 2016–2020 | Mumbai

I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Mumbai. It was less about becoming an engineer and more about learning how things work. Somewhere between data structures and probability, I found machine learning — an idea that data could mimic intuition fascinated me.  

During my undergrad, I worked with Tvarit GmbH in Frankfurt as a Machine Learning Engineer, developing predictive algorithms to reduce manufacturing scrap. A customer segmentation project we built went on to win the European Data Incubator competition. Later, I joined Tessact Pvt Ltd, a media-tech startup, where I improved compliance models using ResNet50 and AWS SageMaker.  

I also contributed to Mozilla’s open-source Project PRESC, helping design evaluation frameworks for ML models. Around that time, I began exploring AI research more deeply — attending the IEEE CVPR Conference in Nashville and the Deployable AI event at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and AI, IIT Madras. Those experiences shaped my understanding of how powerful and responsible AI can coexist.

## 2021–2022 | Mumbai

After graduating, I joined Fractal Analytics as a Data Scientist in the Banking and Retail division. My work revolved around building generative models for synthetic data creation, improving campaign analytics, and monitoring model drift. It was structured and analytical — but I started to notice what was missing.  

I wanted to understand the people behind the numbers — how they think, what drives them, and why we build the things we build.

## 2022–2023 | Mumbai

That curiosity took me out of corporate life and into my own small venture — a cold-pressed coconut oil brand. I handled everything: product, pricing, packaging, marketing. It didn’t scale, but it taught me what no dataset could — how trust and storytelling shape consumer decisions.  

Around the same time, I became a certified AI Trainer under the National Skill Development Corporation, teaching more than 80 students and mentoring early-stage learners through GirlScript Foundation and Upwork. Later, at AVPL International, I led a small team working on soil fertility detection using hyperspectral imagery — we improved prediction accuracy by 21%. It was the first time my technical skills felt truly connected to something tangible.

## 2023–2024 | Paris

I moved to Paris to join ESCP Business School for a Master in Management. I wanted to explore how strategy, innovation, and finance come together to move ideas forward.  

At ESCP, I co-founded two ventures — *Ojas Brew*, an Ayurvedic wellness brand that reached the Top 10 at the Open Blue Venture Challenge, and *Sleep Hive*, a project focused on improving sleep health through wearable technology. These experiences pushed me to see creativity and strategy as two sides of the same process — one fuels the other.

## 2024–2025 | Paris

While studying, I joined the FDI Control Forum as a Business Development Intern, helping manage relationships with 300+ stakeholders for a global M&A event. It taught me how structure and communication drive trust.  

Later, I joined Prelude, a CPaaS technology company, as a Marketing Intern. I helped rebuild its digital presence, created new brand assets, and launched its first video storytelling campaign. Our engagement grew significantly — but what I valued most was realizing that marketing is, in many ways, psychology in motion.  

## 2025–Present | London

I’m now finishing my final year at ESCP’s London campus while continuing my work with Prelude. Outside of work, I lead a Toastmasters International club as President, where I’ve delivered more than 20 speeches and led the club to Distinguished status.  

A few years ago, I published two research papers — *AI Game BOT* and *Sales Prediction System using Machine Learning* — exploring how machine intelligence can better adapt to human reasoning.  

Looking back, my path has always been about understanding — people, products, and the spaces where they meet. From data science to design, from startups to strategy, it all comes back to one thing: learning how to connect meaning with purpose.
