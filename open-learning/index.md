As a person who does a lot of autonomous learning, the Internet in these days offer a huge amount of possibilities to read/learn about any topic you might think of. There might be more the problem of filtering out useful oe even good content from the nearly infinite amount of sources. Inspired by my own learnings and organization style, I will try to give a record of whatever I read/saw and can recommend on specific topics. I will also try to add specific links that I have already studied in the past but may help any interested reader (or myself as lookup). Most stuff will be about machine learning in general and more specific about computer vision/image classification as my master thesis is related to these topics. Along with this I am also documenting everything I learnt and would like to remember from my learnings at ESCP Business School. But from time to time I might add also some more fun related topics and my literary work. I am a decent poet as well. Also, I read a lot so keeping a track of the books here. Following are thesections you can find information on:

- [Machine Learning](machine-learning)
- [Marketing](marketing)
- [Startup](startup)
- [Literature](literature)
